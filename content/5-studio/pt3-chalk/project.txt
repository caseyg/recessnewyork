Title: pt3 chalk

----

Text: We converted a raw 15,000 square foot loft space in Chinatown into a massive one nite only ping pong parlor for the 2010 installation of PT3 (PUMA Table Tennis Tournament), a platform we co-founded for the brand back in 2006. And to celebrate the release of PUMA’s CHALK table designed by aruliden, we painted a chalkboard strip throughout the space for participants and attendees to “leave their mark.” Over 500 of New York’s finest attended the festivities to watch creatives from 32 diverse institutions including Art Directors Club, Ace Hotel, Saturdays, Google Creative Lab, An Choi, Kickstarter and Top Chef Masters winner Marcus Samuelsson compete at a truly one of a kind bikram ping pong experience on a 95 degree nite!

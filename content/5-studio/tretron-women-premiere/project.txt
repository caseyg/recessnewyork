Text: Autumn Winter 2009 marks the fifth season of Tretorn Kläder Men’s Collection and the premiere of the Women’s Collection. Inspired by Alpinists of the 1960s and 1970s and designed with the Tretorn philosophy of simple classics and casual understated style, we presented the collection that included an assortment of knitwear, woven shirts, trousers, skirts, outerwear and accessories at Happy Monkey Studios in midtown.

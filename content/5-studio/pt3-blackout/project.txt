Title: pt3 blackout

----

Text: For the fifth installment of the beloved industry table tennis tournament and to celebrate the release of the new ping pong table designed by brand strategy and design consultancy ARULIDEN, we took over the famed Art Directors Club in the Flat Iron neighborhood for the one nite PT3 (PUMA Table Tennis Tournament) challenge. This yearâ€™s tourney featured the French PT3 champions, Auguste Athletic Club, who were flown in to compete against the New York teams. With 32 teams including newcomers Gilt Groupe, Baron & Baron, Cut & Paste, Gargyle, M ss ng P eces and Rich Brilliant Willing all competing for bragging rights of PT3 champions and a chance to ride away with a pair of Biomega bikes, an intensive late nite battle ensued between the French PT3 champions and reigning New York champions ADstruc in the finals, with the latter walking away with the title in nail-biting fashion.

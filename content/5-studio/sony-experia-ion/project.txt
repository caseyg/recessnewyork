----

Text: For the SONY Xperia ion lifestyle media launch event, we worked with Burson-Marsteller to produce the launch event and took over the penthouse of the Hotel Rivington in the LES for the filming of a crowd sourced music video for the title track from the band Metricâ€™s latest album Synthetica. Audience members were given Xperia ion smartphones to film the performance and the footage was directed by Chris Lenox Smith from The Mixtape Club, known for his work with artists Passion Pit, TV on the Radio & My Morning Jacket.

Title: putt putt park at hudson hotel

----

Text: Launched in tandem with the Masters Golf Tournament, we partnered up with designer Olivier Gregoire to build a mini golf course pop up at Hudson with both casual putt putters and serious golfers in mind, making sure we kept the fun elements like the windmill, paddle wheel and anthill that we all love growing up as a kid but also adding a few pro courses for guests to practice their putting skills. No matter the age or skill level,  we wanted guests to feel nostalgic playing at the month long installation in the whimsical Tequila Park.

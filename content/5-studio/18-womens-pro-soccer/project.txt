Title: Womens Pro Soccer Uniform Launch

----

Text: We were commissioned to conceptualize the fashion unveiling of PUMA WPS Uniforms for the 2009 season with the likes of three-time FIFA Women’s World Player of the Year Marta Vieira da Silva (Los Angeles Sol), US National Team’s Leslie Osborne (FC Gold Pride), Amy Rodriguez (Boston Breakers), Carli Lloyd (Chicago Red Stars) and other WPS stars. We created an astroturf runway while each of the uniforms were elegantly displayed in their respective customized team lockers. The event was hosted by TV personality and two-time Olympic Gold medalist, Summer Sanders and also featured original creation designs by Fashion Designer and Project Runway winner Christian Siriano. Guests were treated to an array of gourmet hotdogs featuring toppings from the various team cities while the opposite wall of the lockers featured projections of moving silhouettes of soccer players in action.

Title: pt3 ultramagnetic

----

Text: PT3 (PUMA Table Tennis Tournament) was conceived in the beginning of 2006 based on a simple idea: to bring a community together for the sheer passion of table tennis, more affectionately known as ping-pong. Now in its 4th season and soaring in popularity, this yearly tournament pits thirty-two teams against each other. Comprised of masters from the cityâ€™s creative underground, teams from New York Times, Formavision, Nom De Guerre, Psyop, Flavorpill, Comedy Central, Shop Architects, Google, Vice, Odin, rude, Staple Design, Turntable Lab and many more were invited to battle it out to the end and proclaim the bragging rights of PT3 champ. The tournament outgrew its secret in a basement in Chinatown so we brought it to life at The Powerhouse Arena in DUMBO. The tournament also gave birth to the ID magazine award-winning Ultramagnetic Collection designed by creative agency aruliden.

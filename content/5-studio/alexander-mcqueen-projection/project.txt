----

Text: To raise awareness of the new collaborative imagery by Alexander McQueen and Show Studioâ€™s Nick Knight for PUMA and The Black Store, we executed a series of week-long guerrilla projections at various locations in the city during fashion week. The 8 days of projections gained an average of 13,000-15,000 impressions per night. Projections executed by Neverstop Stealth Van.

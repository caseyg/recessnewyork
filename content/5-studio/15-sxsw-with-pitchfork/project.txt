Text: For Pitchfork’s #OFFLINE outdoor music festival at SXSW back in March 2011 at the East Side Drive-In, we helped set up both a gifting suite and gaming area for PUMA for the musical acts and attendees, in conjunction with the brand’s global social campaign. 2 simultaneous stages with an array of artists like Dum Dum Girls, Toro Y Moi, PS I Love You, Smith Westerns, J Mascis, Dodos, Mount Kimbie, Baths, Yuck, Owen Pallett, Edwyn Collins, Dirty Beaches, Gold Panda and more performed at the festival over the 2 days.

Title: Tretorn Store Launch

----

Text: Swedish outdoor lifestyle brand Tretorn officially opened their first New York City storefront on July 15, 2008 in Soho. To celebrate their flagship opening, we converted an outdoor retail lot usually occupied by street vendors into a hedge garden and hosted a picnic for press and special guests. Award winning Chef Marcus Samuelsson of Acquavit, New Yorkâ€™s premier Scandinavian restaurant, catered the picnic and food were served in outdoor meal kits By Light My Fire.

Text: To celebrate the launch of Design Within Reach founder Rob Forbes new venture, PUBLIC Bikes, we helped organize Design Ride Manhattan during Design Week. Bicyclists comprising of a motley group of designers, friends and bike lovers took a leisurely ride from the ICFF at Jacob Javits Convention Center to the Tretorn store in Soho, followed by a reception. Public Bikes were on display, and test rides were available there during ICFF and afterwards.

Title: Kehinde Wiley at Deitch Gallery

----

Text: To herald the start of the 2010 World Cup year and to celebrate PUMA’s long-standing partnership with African football as a sponsor to 12 African teams, the brand partnered with Kehinde Wiley, one of the world’s most sought-after artists, and commissioned him to create four original works of art inspired by three of football’s most decorated players, Samuel Eto’o, John Mensah and Emmanuel Eboue. We produced the week long exhibition that included a short behind-the-scenes film screening in collaboration with Deitch Gallery.

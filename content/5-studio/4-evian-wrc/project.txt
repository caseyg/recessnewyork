----

Text: The first annual Evian Wooden Racquet Cup was held on August 2012 at the West Side Club in Forest Hills, home of the original US Open held from 1915 till 1977. In collaboration with MKG Productions, we consulted on all aspects of the retro tournament, from working out a format for the team challenge to structuring specific rules of play and bracket for the invited teams as well as team solicitation for the one day winner take all challenge. Judah Friedlander was the celebrity host for the tournament. Participating organizations include Facebook, WWD, Warby Parker, Refinery 29, NY Times, Complex, Record Setter, Syrup, 40 Lovers, RCRD LBL & Flavorpill.

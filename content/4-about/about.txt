### Participation is always voluntary at RECESS. Passion, however, is mandatory.

Igniting the city's competitive spirit thru recreational sports, music + culture since 2009, RECESS is an ongoing series of sporting challenges with a mixtape club for creatives.

We host playful sporting events throughout the year and every first Tuesday of the month, we publish an online mixtape series called INTERMISSION featuring 4 guest selectors from diverse creative backgrounds, each 30mins long to showcase their musical palette.

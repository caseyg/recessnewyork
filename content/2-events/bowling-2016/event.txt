Text: Calling all troublemakers. We're hosting a 20-team bowling tournament on **Monday March 21st** at **Brooklyn Bowl**  to kick off the 2016 season so purchase your **TEAM SLOT** now and show them who's boss on the lanes! You'll need 4 players to form a team, at least one female. We've got 10 lanes booked for the championship, plus there'll be live musical performances from 4 bands that evening curated by Brooklyn Bowl. It's going to be a very special nite of smack talking and pin bashing so don't miss out!

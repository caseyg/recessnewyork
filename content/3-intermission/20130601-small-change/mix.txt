Text: RECESS is a SCAM ppl!! Its Khairi's ponzi scheme to get everyone else to do mixes for him. Dude is worse than Madoff. We're all grinding while dude is sipping on guava margarita in Guam. Who's RECESS is this? Who's on vacation here?! I keed I keed.  Great idea for a series, very glad to be a part of it.  I threw together a set of 45s, mostly soul on the deeper side, with a few variations at the end. Music I love, and still love 20 years down the road. Enjoy ppls!

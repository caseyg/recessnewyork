Text: Man, I loved that red car, cassettes tumbling around down the winding rounds to get there. You have to park up right up the back. Then we walk down the tree-lined path in silence, which opens up to the rocks that fall down to the sea. Climbing down the rocks it takes a while, then we are there, our own personal beach.

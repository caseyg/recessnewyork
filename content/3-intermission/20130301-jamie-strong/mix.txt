Text: In a world that's constantly turnin' up and tuning out, it's time to turn down and tune in... and that is the essence of RECESS. It's a time where you can take a break from the modern world and the constant need to be connected to likes, double taps, retweets, followers, swipes, snaps, vines, winks and so on. This playlist is about living in the moment without any distractions and letting the music take you on a journey.

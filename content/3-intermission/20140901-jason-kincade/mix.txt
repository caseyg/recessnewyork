Text: When I was a kid, I used to record songs from the radio to make my own "mixtapes" and later when I got my first cheap stereo and discovered the record store/head shop (couldn't go behind the curtain but I could buy records) I remember recording them onto cassette so I could listen to them on my Walkman. This mix hearkens back to those times - a group of songs that work to create a mood - some old,some new. Enjoy.

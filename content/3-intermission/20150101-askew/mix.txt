text: For as long as I can remember, the music has been my personal RECESS. As a kid, the power of music allowed me to dream and travel anywhere I wanted to go in my mind. Through my quest for the perfect beat, I was able to visit places like Rio De Janeiro, Detroit, Lagos, Tokyo, and London, learning about different music cultures along the way. Here you'll find a few selections from my vinyl journeys throughout the years. Enjoy!

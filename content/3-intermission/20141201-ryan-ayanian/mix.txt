Text: 

I spend FAR too much time making playlists (sometimes, I get paid for it). The tracks I've chosen reflect my mood at the moment. What that is, I don't know. Maybe you can tell me? Hope you enjoy them.

P.S. Yes, I know they are all REMIXES. Perhaps that's further insight into my current mood? Or maybe they're just really good songs that become great remixed? Hmm.

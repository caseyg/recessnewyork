Text: In the 50s, my grandfather managed a record shop near Times Square frequented by jazz greats like Lester Young and Gil Evans. In the 60s, my father went to Woodstock. I grew up with a varied soundtrack. For me, RECESS often meant digging into a record, devouring full albums from start to finish, liner notes and all. These are some sounds I've vibed to along the way, and includes a world premiere of my instrumental song "Extra Fancy."

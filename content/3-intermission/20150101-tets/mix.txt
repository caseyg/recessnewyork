Text: As an art director at The Mill and DJ living in New York, I often need to spend some time in a place of solitude or pampering to be reinvigorated, which is why I’ve listed down 5 of my “secret spots” to do just that. Ok maybe not so secret after all but I love them all! Como Shambala in Bali, Corner Room in London, Praia do Beliche at Sagres, Brooklyn Navy Yard & Lake Powell in Utah

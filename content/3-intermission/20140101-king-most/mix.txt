Text: The thought of RECESS takes me back to All Souls Catholic school in South San Francisco when I was a kid. Nowadays a semblance of random rituals helps put me at ease, like drinking Phillz coffee, trip to my parents or enjoying music. Sometimes I'll put all those disparate items together to create a feeling, just like how I made this mix. Part French Jazz, part British Invasion, part Queensbridge rappers, and much more. Enjoy the ride!

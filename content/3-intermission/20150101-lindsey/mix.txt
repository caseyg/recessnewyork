text: Smokey: Why you not goin' to work? Craig: I got fired yesterday. Smokey: No shit? I thought you had the day off yesterday. Craig: I did. I went in to pick up my check, came home, my supervisor called me about four o'clock, told me he got me on tape stealing boxes. Smokey: The fuck you stealing boxes for? What you trying to build, a clubhouse?

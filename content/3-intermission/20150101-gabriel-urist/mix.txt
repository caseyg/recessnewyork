Text: A former neighbor Ethel, said to me, "I hear the music you're constantly playing and it reminds me of the stuff that me and my sisters used to play. We would dance, and I used to DJ, still got all my old 45s from back then (1968-1986), do you want 'em?" I don't really know how to thank her for that, except to dedicate this little mix to her. Many of the tracks on this mix are transferred from Ethel's old 45s. My brother Josh produced this mix with me.

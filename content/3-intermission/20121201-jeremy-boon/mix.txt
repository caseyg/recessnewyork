Text: Mountain biking at the nature reserve, hanging out with my kids by the pool and eating my favorite dish, the original Singapore chilli crab are some of my favorite past time. I'm one of the fortunate few who can truly say stepping into my office is like walking into a candy store, take a look at the record collection spanning 20 years of dance music!

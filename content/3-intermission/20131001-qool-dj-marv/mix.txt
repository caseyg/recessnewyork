Text: Left turns at corners. Page turns on riverside benches. Rooty juicy fresh unless char grilled wild tuna's my tongue's request. Swims in the deep end to float in space. Finds it swell to dwell on do well. Sky-blue notes and full measures; Self-affirming and determining lyrics are my pleasure. Determined to detour minds toward the bright direction. Chart the course.

Text: This mix is fueled by emerging artists from New York and Philly, to London and Stockholm, and was a lot of fun to compile. The music journey, that starts in the states and ends where there's no gravity, travels through soul sounds via breezy rooftops, and swings by the dance floors of UK and Sweden. Hope you enjoy it. Blessings.

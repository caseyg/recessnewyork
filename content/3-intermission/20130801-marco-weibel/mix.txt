Text: Music, the deepest RECESS of the mind. From tearing shrink wrap off new wax, to cuing up, to the joyful noise. This quick mix was done on a lazy Sunday morning, two 1200s, a mixer, some records and scratch live. Straight out of sunny Singapore, a sonic travel through Jazz, Boogie, Brazilian, Hip Hop and BEYOND. Hope you dig!

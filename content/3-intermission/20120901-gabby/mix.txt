Text: I was actually a pretty shy kid, but there were three things that could always bring me out of my shell completely uninhibited: music, dancing and the sea. It probably stems from our house always being filled with music cause my mother was a singer and an artist, and my adventurous father had a penchant for anything maritime, so we were all water babies. I work hard to RECESS hard... preferably by the sea!

Text: This collection (called A Dinner In Heaven) was inspired by an imaginary dinner party yet to happen but one that I always wanted to host. Enjoy it anywhere - on a walk, a bike ride, on the train, in the city or out in the country.  It's wonderful how a collection of music can take you anywhere, and each listen could lead to a new destination.  Many years before actually moving to NYC, I fantasized about "Taking the L train to 8th Avenue", all because of a song...

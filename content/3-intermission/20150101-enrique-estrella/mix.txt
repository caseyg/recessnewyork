Text: 

Remember when you had RECESS in elementary school twice a day not even counting lunch? Dipping below the radar and dropping out for a few weeks is my idea of RECESS nowadays and most recently spent in the beautiful islands of the Philippines. Smile, enjoy the tunes, and move your hips. It's ok, no one's watching.

Enjoy the mix.

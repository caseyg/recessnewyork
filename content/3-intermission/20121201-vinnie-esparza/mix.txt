Text: Whenever I am not getting my exercise hauling records from one place to another, I enjoy running cross-country. I feel like a country boy trapped in the hectic city, so taking some time to run the hell away from my problems for a few hours is much needed and appreciated. It allows me to focus on the important things in life, like where I can find more records.

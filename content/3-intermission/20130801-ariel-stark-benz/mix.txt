Text: RECESS was good to me starting at a very young age. At the hippie school I attended since kindergarten, you referred to teachers by their first name, you could wear hats, and they permitted the skate session that I used for my daily recess. Now its typically spent at Rockaway, or less often Playa Avellanas for surf sessions.

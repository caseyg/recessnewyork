Text: I move from place to place. I don't go just to visit. Sometimes, I go to live. So, I guess I see everything as one big jumbled RECESS. With every different setting comes a new discovery about one's musical taste. So, this mix represents the taste I've acquired in my travels. Spanning culture and time, the selections share a common thread of individuality, in terms of concepts of rhythm and melody.

Text: In school I spent my RECESS first in comic stores, and then moved on to record stores. Just couldn't afford to maintain both my comic book habit and my burgeoning interest in vinyl. Nowadays time is the luxury that's hard to afford, so taking RECESS with the ones you love is especially important.

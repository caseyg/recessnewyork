text: I’m calling this mix of mine “Top Seven under 30” cuz these are seven of my all time favorite songs in less than 30 minutes. Get it? Besides making music, I also have a background in the vintage furniture business, and currently do a little consulting work for a website that represents the world’s top antique and 20th century design dealers. Don’t ask me how I ended up doing that! Enjoy...

Text: I remember a few years back I was driving with my wife and my friend Deidre, and Deidre said "Myles you have the musical taste of a 45 year old black woman." I took it as a compliment. I listen to a lot of R&B and always have, this is an R&B mix with a sort of mellow Sunday afternoon type feel, I hope you all enjoy it.

Text: Brasil has had a special place in my life since 2006. Its beautiful, vibrant and carefree culture and lifestyle was the perfect balance to the hustle and bustle style of New York. Rio de Janeiro became my yearly RECESS until moving here in January 2012. I probably enjoyed the chasing girls part of school more than anything else.

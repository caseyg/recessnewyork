text: I tend to approach things cerebrally instead of emotionally when it comes to my works and life in general, so with this mix, I wanted to put together songs which celebrate the beauty of being in love, or the ones which makes you want to fall in love on the dance floor (and the cover is referencing that as well). Here are 7 songs to bring the romance back.

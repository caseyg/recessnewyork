Text: I never understood how other people can identify just one of something as absolutely the best in that category to them. I love too many things too much to make those decisions. But I might have a favorite sport. Skiing. Probably because I was never good at any sport until I learned to ski. When I was in third grade, the whole school would go skiing every Friday during the winter. It's one of the few fond memories I have from that year.

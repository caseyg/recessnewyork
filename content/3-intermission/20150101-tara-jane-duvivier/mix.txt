Text: Walking is my most favorite activity to do in this city. If it's warm enough and I have the time to spare, I'll put on my headphones and walk around for hours with no destination in mind. I like to walk up certain streets so I can "visit" with buildings I like, peek behind construction sheds, maybe pop into a spot or two. If a song comes up that has a beat that falls instep with my stride, I get really happy-it's a sweet spot.

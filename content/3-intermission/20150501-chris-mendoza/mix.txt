Text: I was born in Nicaragua surrounded by music, soccer, art and architecture. The sounds, color and infectious energy were always present in the cities I've lived and visited. Music plays a vital role in my development as an artist, friend and citizen of the world. I manifest my highest potential thru sketching, photography, writing and music. Enjoy the EXTRAORDINARY EVERYDAYWALKMAN mix!

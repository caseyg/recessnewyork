text: I'm an analog man. I like the city. Sometimes I wish I were closer to the forest. Shame it's so quiet. Lately I've been wondering if it's time to move somewhere less hectic? I miss being able to breathe loudly, walk quietly and just explore places that feel like they exist solely for you. But then I hear music and realize that it doesn't live among the pines. It lives among the concrete. So I think I'll stick around. Enjoy the mix.

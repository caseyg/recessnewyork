Text: I have been collecting Jamaican records for 15 years and my RECESS is listening to Jamaican music especially Studio One classic songs. So I made a short mix of my favorite Studio One tunes and hope you enjoy it! - Mr. K is one of the selectors from Deadly Dragon Sound and also has been working at Deadly Dragon Retail Store (102 B Forsyth St, New York) since 2008.

Text: A true master Domenico DeMarco is known to often say "if you no love it, you no do it." As a child, there's no greater feeling than when the clock strikes and it's time for RECESS, that break from the monotony of the dry school day. That needed time is a chance to escape and refresh the mind's palate. I found that same escape and solace within music at a young age. As I grew with it, I was able to expand my vocabulary, do what I love and love what I do.

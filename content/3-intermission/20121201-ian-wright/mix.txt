Text: I must have been about nine when my dad brought home the huge Radiogram. He installed an extra speaker on the landing, right outside my bedroom so that we could have music upstairs. On Friday nights I would lie in the dark, drifting off to sleep whilst listening to Radio Luxembourg, which seem to come in over the shifting airwaves from somewhere beyond. That early introduction to sound must have shaped my listening habits forever.

text: This mix was inspired by Rene Daumal's Mount Analog as well as Alejandro Jodorowsky's Holy Mountain. In addition to the generally druggy and bugged-out character of the two works, what continually draws me to them is the idea of the peradam, an object which is revealed only to those who search for it. I take comfort in the idea that out there are truths as yet unknown and beauty undiscovered, just waiting for somebody to take notice and seek them out.

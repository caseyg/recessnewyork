Text: Almost everything I do to give myself a bit of RECESS time is music related. Whether I'm hunkering down in my bedroom studio to whip out a new track, slapping together a mixtape or curating the latest releases on our mp3 download shop BAGPAK.net, I find that music allows me to effortlessly keep my mind off my mind. Here's a mixtape I imagine is what the last 30 mins of my deejay set at a Prom might sound like. Enjoy.

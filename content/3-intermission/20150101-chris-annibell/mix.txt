Text: 2:20pm, Monday to Friday is when RECESS began.  It was the time the school day ended and I could head back to the crib, pick up my drum sticks, get behind the kit and zone inward; looking for the place where music collided with spirituality. 4 Hours a day, funky mediations, drenched to the bone. This was the beginning of what became a long, beautiful love affair with music, and her power to move us all.

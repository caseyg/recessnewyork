Text: I love music. I listen to it all day every day and I listen to reggae on low volume when I sleep. I'm also lazy about finding new stuff. When I turned 13, my mom let me go to Loolapalooza, a huge music festival. The year was 1991 and Jane's Addiction was the headliner. It was the best show I ever saw and my taste in music hasn't changed that much since then. Thanks for listening!!

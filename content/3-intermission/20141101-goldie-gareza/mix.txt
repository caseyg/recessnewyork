Text: 

Our family had a least five different boxes of cereal on constant rotation; you could go a full school week without having the same kind twice! I compare my memories of childhood cereal to the music mixes I make... never the same genre for long. (Although I have a weakness for old school.)

I started whistling when I was 4 years old, and even back then I took no requests.

Text: When Greg Nice said "Dizzy Gillespie played the sax," he could not have been further from the truth but his heart was in the right place. A smorgasbord of jazz inspired beats and possibly a little record skip here and there, enjoy these dubbed out trumpet and sexy saxophone jazz vibes mixed live. Remember this: "yesterday is history, tomorrow's mystery, today is a gift; and that's why they call it the present," bless up!

text: Recess was my favorite part of school as a kid. I still love the moments when you can get all the energy out of your system. Taking a break from your day, connecting with friends, and doing whatever the fuck you enjoy. I'm all over the place. 

I have to switch it up, depending on the season I'm looking for trouble.

Text: It's my life long goal to be working the way it looks like playing and not my Calgon to take me away. Love is the only true purpose in life, and living is what is happening now before dying. We need all the goods in our lives: family, friends, people, places, eats, drinks, luck, loving, understanding, perspecting and blessings. Sometimes, a lotta times, shit can get rough and Calgon just barely cuts it. Find that little bit and appreciate it.

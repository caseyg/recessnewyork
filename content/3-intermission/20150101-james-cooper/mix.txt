text: This is what 1990 London sounded like to me, all those years ago when I was 18. I was DJ-ing, throwing parties, going to Ibiza and Rimini. Traveling the world via nightclubs. All these songs are recorded from my original record collection - you'll hear the crackles. I like the crackles. Love the crackles.

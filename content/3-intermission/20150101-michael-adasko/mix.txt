Text: Music has always been my soundtrack; defining every moment and season with clarity. When I made career moves from music, food literally overflowed with all of the emotion I learned through my life with music. The dissonance, breaks, harmony, crescendo and bass found a new medium, but the heart and soul remain. Steadily, always.

Text: My personal RECESS has always been the place where I am able to lose sense of the monotony of the everyday. It's the essential pause in my eternal search for fun.  I grew up in the mountains but have lived to the city for the last decade.  Music helps me bridge the gap between where I'm from and where I'm going. This mix is an effort to look back over some of the sounds that have influenced me over the past few years while keeping a keen eye on what's next.

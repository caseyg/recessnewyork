Text: 

One spring day, I packed a whole bag of potato chips and a few cans of coke, dropped them on the backseat of my old Ford and drove anywhere... just anywhere. The car was blasting music from the radio and tapes, enjoyed myself as a stranger from town to town. 

That was my RECESS...still is.

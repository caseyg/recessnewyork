Text: When was the last time you did something for the first time? My personal RECESS revolves around this mantra. It could be as simple as hearing a record, visiting a new city, state, country or restaurant for the first time. Exploration is the key to life. RECESS to me is all about the casual vibes & sounds so this playlist is meant to be enjoyed while sitting on your porch with a cold one in hand & appreciating the simple things in life.

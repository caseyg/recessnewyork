Text: The greatest book ever written is Kon-Tiki by Thor Heyerdahl. I can't think of anything else in the world that defines my personal RECESS better than building a raft in Central America and sailing it across the ocean to what is essentially a lost island all in the name of proving a point. Ocean bound, ultimate freedom, sharks circling under the raft, whales stopping by to offer support and flying fish frying in a pan for breakfast in the morning. Freedom is the mission.

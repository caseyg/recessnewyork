Text: Igniting the cityâ€™s competitive spirit thru recreational sports, music + culture since 2009, RECESS is an ongoing series of sporting challenges with a mixtape club for creatives. We host playful sporting events throughout the year and every first Tuesday of the month, we publish an online mixtape series called INTERMISSION featuring 4 guest selectors from diverse creative backgrounds, each 30 mins long to showcase their musical palette. Our studio has worked with international lifestyle brands to help create memorable brand experiences through strategic lifestyle marketing, design and event production services.
